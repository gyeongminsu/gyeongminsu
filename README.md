Hi. I am Minsoo-Gyeong, B.S-M.S Ingegrated Student of Computer Science(6th semester) in University of Seoul.

I am currently focusing my attention on the development of Artificial Intelligence models(mainly in Large Language Model).

As part of that, I am currently working at [Natural Language Computing Lab](https://nlc-uos.github.io/) advised by Prof. Kyungjae Lee in University of Seoul From May 2024.

And From July 2023 to July 2024, I had been working as the 20th Vice Club President of [Tobigâ€™s, the AI & Big data Union Academic Club in Korea](https://tobigs-datamarket.github.io/).

Finally, I am also very interested in the phisolophy of science(e.g. Scientific Realism/Anti-Realism, Kuhn's Normal Science).
